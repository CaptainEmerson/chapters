%What is the effect of programming languages on software quality?
%==================================================================

Before starting a new software project, you might wonder which programming language you should begin with. 
For example, you might consider writing a Desktop application in  C, C++, C\#, Objective-C, 
Java, Python, Ruby, Scala,  Go, or even Haskell. Of course, the list continues. Although developers often choose languages based on their prior experiences or legacy requirements, as reported by Meyerovich et al. [2], the question still remains: "Which programming language should be the right tool for this job"?.  While some of these debates may appear to be tinged with an almost religious fervor, most agree that programming language choice can impact both the coding process and the resulting artifact.

Advocates of strong static typing argue that type inference will catch software bugs early, at compile time; 
for them, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. In contrast, advocates of dynamic typing argue that 
rather than spending a lot of time correcting annoying static type errors, it is better to rely on dynamic typing to
 catch errors on run time, if they at all arise. Similarly, controversy arises over other language features:  
 strong vs. weak typing, procedural vs. functional language, managed vs. un-managed memory etc. These debates,
  however, have largely been of the armchair variety, supported only by anecdotal evidence.

It turns out, according to a study by University of California Davis researchers [1], the impact of programming language on code quality is pretty small. By empirically analyzing 17 most popular languages from GitHub comprising of 728 projects, 63 million lines of code, 1.5 million commits from 29,000 developers, the researchers found only a ``modest" effects of language on code quality.
