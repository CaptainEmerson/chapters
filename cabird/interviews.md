#Interviews

##Why?
Used often as initial exploratory investigation.  Unlike quantitative methods, you can learn about things you had no prior ideas or hypotheses about.  Allows rich engagement, follow up questions, etc.  You can collect historical data that is not recorded anywhere, can elicit opinions and impressions in richer detail than written communication.  Can triangulate with other data collection techniques.  Can be used to clarify things that have already happened (especially following an observation).

##Types of interviews
 - Structured - Exact set of questions, often quantitative in nature, uses an interview script
 - Semi-Structured - High level questions, usually qualitative, and uses an interview guide
 - Unstructured - High level list of topics, exploratory in nature, often a conversation, used in ethnographies and case-studies.


##Selecting Sample

Random sampling is not the best approach since your sample will likely not be large and you won't be doing quantitative analysis anyways.  Select a sampling that gives you the most "coverage" and breadth.  Sometimes called stratified sampling.  One method is snowball sampling.  An orthogonal method to use is saturation.  Once you have covered your population and you have conducted a few interviews and learned nothing new, you have most likely saturated and further interviews are unlikely to provide much value.

##Interview Guide
 * Contains an organized list of high level questions.
 * ONLY A GUIDE!
 * Questions can be skipped, asked out of order, followed up on, etc.
 * Helps with pacing and to make sure core areas are covered.


##Recruitment
 * Introduce yourself.
 * Tell them what your goal is.
 * How can it benefit them?
 * How long will it take?
 * Do they need any preparation?
 * Why did you select them in particular?

##Conducting the interview
Two people is best
	Tend to ask more questions == more info
	Less “down time”
	One writes, one talks
	Discuss afterwards
	Three or more can be threatening
Ask to record.  Still take notes (What if it didn’t record!)
You want to listen to them, don’t make them listen to you!
Face to face is best, even if online.
Be aware of time.



##Post Interview
Write down post-interview notes.  Thoughts, impressions, discussion with co-interviewer, follow-ups.
Do you need to continue interviewing? (saturation)
Do you need to modify your guide?
Do you need to transcribe?

##Transcription?
Verbatim == time consuming or expensive and error prone.  (but still may be worth it)

Partial transcription: capture the main idea in 10-30 second chunks.

##Analysis
Card Sorting is the best we've found

##Reporting
 * Number of interviewees, how they were selected, how they were recruited
 * Duration and location of interviews, how they were conucted (skype?  In person?)
 * Any guides or artifacts used

 * Quotes can provide richness and insight and is engaging
 * don't cherry pick
 * no quantitative analysis… but can drive surveys or other quantitative methods.
