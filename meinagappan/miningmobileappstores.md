## Introduction

Today, software engineering research focuses on traditional software systems like the Firefox web browser or Microsoft Windows [19], which take years to develop and teams of designers, developers and debuggers. Software engineering is rapidly changing though. Emerging domains, such as mobile devices, are growing rapidly and depend heavily on new software operating systems like Android and the applications that they run, commonly referred to as apps. Over the past few years, we have seen a boom in the popularity of mobile devices and mobile apps that run on these devices [1]. Recent market studies predict that the global mobile app economy is expected to be worth $143 billion by 2016 [17]. Thus there exists considerable impact in solving the challenges faced by several different stakeholders like the mobile app developers, users, and platform owners (like Apple/BlackBerry/Google/Microsoft).

Mobile apps, unlike traditional software are distributed by the developers directly to the end users via a centralized platform called the app store. Along with the executable mobile app, the app stores contain a large set of meta-data about the app. For each app any end user is able to look at the name and contact details of the developer, description, sample screenshots, feature set of the app, number of downloads and the price for the app. Additionally, the app stores allow users to post reviews of the apps. This is very different from traditional software. Mobile app developers get continuous feedback from users that can be leveraged to help them. For example, prior work leveraged user reviews to extract user-faced issues [12, 11], and new requirements [4].

Using the data from the app stores, several companies like App Annie1, (which recently bought another company - Distimo2) and Appfigures3 have even built successful businesses selling intelligence gained from observing the evolution of several hundred thousand apps in the app stores. Similar to such businesses, researchers can mine the store for meta-data of the apps and the apps themselves [3], and analyze the mined data to compile empirical results to help the various stakeholders of mobile apps. Even the feedback provided by end users on the mobile apps (including closed source apps from private companies) is publicly available in the app stores for researchers to mine.

Since 2012 [6, 20] researchers have begun to mine the data in the mobile app stores to address relevant software engineering issues. One such example is the mining of the feedback given as user reviews in mobile app stores for understanding the end user perspective. We describe some of the advancements made in this regard, below.
