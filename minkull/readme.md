Two chapters:

- Ensembles as versatile learning tools -- e.g., for transfer learning, changing environments, multiple objectives, etc.

- How you learn does matter and there are many ways you can do this
(active, continuous, etc.)


PS.: the ensembles chapter has two figures that I wanted to have the text wrapped around. However, this doesn't seem to work in GitHub markdown. I guess the publisher would be able to deal with that.
