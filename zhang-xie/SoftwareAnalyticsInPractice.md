# Software Analytics in Practice

## Dongmei Zhang and Tao Xie

Various types of data naturally exist in the software development process, such as source code, bug reports, check-in histories, and test cases. Analytics techniques have been used on these data sources to help understand software quality in the last few decades. In recent years, there are various examples of leveraging software artifacts to improve software engineering practices, such as software intelligence [4] and analytics for software development [1], both offering software engineers pertinent information to support their decision making in software engineering practices.

Considering the increasing abundance and importance of data in the software domain, software analytics is to expand the scope of previous work on analytics for software development [1] and on software intelligence [4]. In particular, software analytics [6,7] is to utilize data-driven approaches to enable software practitioners to perform data exploration and analysis in order to obtain insightful and actionable information for completing various tasks around software systems, software users, and software development process.
